2. Copy the desired translation folder (e.g. `languages/fr`) into `site/lang`.
3. Set `locale: fr` (or translation of choice) in your Control Panel settings area (or `site/settings/cp.yaml`) to apply to all users, or in individual user's files (e.g. `site/users/{username}.yaml`) to apply to only that user.
